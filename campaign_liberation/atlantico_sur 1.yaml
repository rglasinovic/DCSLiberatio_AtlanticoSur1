description:
  <p>An Argentinean extremist group has contracted the Sons of Warvan (SoW), an
  unusually well-equipped PMC with close ties to the Russian government, to
  construct a beryllium bomb at the secret Omega 13 production facility in Ushaia
  for use in its ongoing conflict with Chile. United States military forces have
  established a foothold at San Julian. While the SoW are distracted up north, it
  is up to the Marines to launch an assault upon Ushaia from an LHA in order to
  disable the bomb production facility. Fortunately, Ushaia is lightly defended as
  the SoW are trying to avoid unwanted attention.</p>
